                <h1>Photista</h1>
                <p class="bio">Photista <span>2020</span> is a series of mini projects exploring the topic of marine algae. The name Photista is a combination of two 
                    words: Photosynthesis <span>/ˌfōdōˈsinTHəsəs/</span> and Protista <span>/prōˈtistə/</span>.</p>
                <p class="bio">Photosynthesis <span>noun</span> is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods from carbon dioxide 
                    and water. Photosynthesis in plants generally involves the green pigment chlorophyll and generates oxygen as a byproduct.</p>
                <p class="bio">Protista <span>noun</span> is a kingdom or large grouping that comprises mostly single-celled organisms such as the protozoa, simple algae and fungi, 
                    slime molds, and (formerly) the bacteria. They are now divided among up to thirty phyla, and some have both plant and animal characteristics.</p>

                    <p class="bio">The choice to use 3D modeling as the medium was to represent that this field of
                        research is difficult to access depending on the
                        location. Most of the data is collected by researchers and scientists who have the equipment to
                        analyze these macro and micro species.</p>
                    <p class="bio">The anemone and the coral in the still life represents the organisms that algae deem
                        as hosts. These organisms require the nutrients
                        provided by photosynthetic algae to survive. The plant and bowl represent consumption by people
                        and other organisms (Algae are primary producers).
                        The bowl of kelp represents the common macroalgae that can be found ranging from life in the
                        oceans, to our food markets, and health products.</p>

                    <p class="bio">The flag prompt helped me to focus on how to create a system of design that is clear
                        and easy to replicate. I have 11 steps here to
                        recreate this exact design in illustrator or figma. Overall, this project helped me to think
                        about: “How can we use design as a tool for
                        teaching?”</p>
                    <p class="bio"><b>Photista Flag: 11 Steps in Illustrator and Figma</b></p>
                    <p class="bio">1. Create a canvas that is 1920 x 1080 px and fill it with the color value #1F587F.
                    </p>
                    <p class="bio">2. Create two squares with the color value of #FBDA33 and align them vertically,
                        select both squares and scale them to fit the top
                        and bottom of the canvas.</p>
                    <p class="bio">3. Delete the top square.</p>
                    <p class="bio">4. Create four little squares with the color value of #4A9339 and scale them
                        proportionally to fit inside the bottom yellow square.
                        The four green squares should now be covering the yellow square.</p>
                    <p class="bio">5. Delete the top left green square.</p>
                    <p class="bio">6. Select the top right green square and curve its top left corner fully (in
                        Illustrator pull the corner back fully) (set the
                        corner radius to 360° in Figma). and repeat with the bottom left green square.</p>
                    <p class="bio">7. For the bottom right green square, take its bottom right corner and curve it fully
                        in Illustrator (corner radius to 360° in
                        Figma).</p>
                    <p class="bio">8. Now take the main yellow square and curve it proportionally fully on all sides in
                        Illustrator (set the corner radius of all the
                        sides to 360° in Figma) the result should be a yellow circle.</p>
                    <p class="bio">9. Select all three green curved squares and add a 10px stroke with the color value
                        of #4A9339 (outer-stroke in Illustrator)
                        (center-stroke in Figma). Change the fill of the squares to be the color value of #1F587F (same
                        as background).</p>
                    <p class="bio">10. Now group the shapes we just created (don’t group the blue canvas background) and
                        align it with the center of the canvas.</p>
                    <p class="bio">11. Finally, shift + rotate the grouped object clockwise once which is 315° in
                        Illustrator (set the rotation to -45° in Figma)</p>

        <p class="bio" id="italic">Design, according to the dictionary, is an arrangement of lines or shapes created to
            form a pattern or
            decoration. Design, according to myself, is founded through rules, changed by our own rules, and takes on
            the traits of the creator. Design, to me, is an endless void of history, creativity, and innovation.</p>

        <p class="bio">Hello my name is In Seok Suh! I was born in Seoul, South Korea, but have been raised in the
            midwest for most
            of my life. I became tired of looking at cornfields and moved to the east coast to pursue a BFA degree. I'm
            officially a 2021 BFA graduate from the Maryland Institute College of Art with my degree in Graphic Design.

        <div class="break1"></div>

        <p class="bio">And I love everything about design! My works range from typographic posters, to motion graphics,
            and coding / web design!</p>

            <div class="break1"></div>
            <p class="answers">I enjoy reading and I also love singing. I feel that reading is a great way to relax and
                let the mind wander into new territories.
                I believe that books are also a great source as they are the most refined version of the writer's
                thoughts and research. I also love all genres of music
                and singing! Lately, I've been into Korean ballads and they've helped me learn more about the Korean
                culture and language. It's always exciting
                to come across new vibes~ üéµ</p>

            <div class="break1"></div>
            <p class="answers">Faith is a foundational element in my core and identity. I believe that to truly
                understand and believe something, one must first
                experience it. No human knows the future, but I will keep striving and working my best in faith and love
                to grow further His kingdom.
                <span>For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking but of righteousness and peace and
                    joy in the Holy Spirit. -Romans 14:17</span>

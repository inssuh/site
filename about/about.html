            <p id="italics">Design, according to the dictionary, is an arrangement of lines or shapes created to form a pattern or decoration. Design, according to myself, is 
                founded through rules, changed by our own rules, and takes on the traits of the creator. Design, to me, is an endless void of history, creativity, 
                and innovation.</p>

            <p>Hello my name is In Seok Suh! I was born in Seoul, South Korea, but have been raised in the midwest for most of my life. I became tired of looking at 
                cornfields and moved to the east coast to pursue a BFA degree. I'm officially a 2021 BFA graduate from the Maryland Institute College of Art with 
                my degree in Graphic Design.</p>

            <p>And I love everything about design! My works range from typographic posters, to motion graphics, and coding / web design!</p>

                        Press, 1998.</a>

                    <p>Marston Bates was a cultural biologist and professor emeritus of zoology at the University of
                        Michigan. Bates was known for his
                        scientific writings and achievements such as his studies on mosquitoes which contributed to the
                        understanding of the epidemiology of yellow
                        fever in northern South America. The Forest and the Sea written by Marston Bates, was
                        recommended to me by professor Kristian Bjornard. This
                        book explores a wide range of biological information about the interrelationship of man and
                        nature. “It probes deep into man's danger to
                        himself and that interlinked organic web by which he lives,” commented anthropologist Loren
                        Eiseley.</p>

                    <p>Naomi Klein is an award-winning journalist, columnist, and author of the New York Times and
                        international bestsellers
                        The Shock Doctrine, No Logo, This Changes Everything, and No Is Not Enough. In This Changes
                        Everything Naomi Klein presses on the issues
                        of the ever changing climate. Klein argues that climate change isn’t just another issue to be
                        neatly filed between taxes and health care.
                        It’s an alarm that calls us to fix an economic system that is already failing us in many ways.
                        She writes about the issues of greenhouse
                        emissions and the positive effects that addressing this issue would have. She also provides
                        documentation of the inspiring movements that
                        have already begun: “communities that are not just refusing to be sites of further fossil fuel
                        extraction but are building the next,
                        regeneration-based economies right now.”</p>

                    <p>In The Ocean of Life, Callum Roberts writes about the earliest traces of life on earth to the
                        current oceans. He writes about
                        the impacts of fishing and ocean acidification, rising tides and warming seas, plastics and
                        shifting currents, and reveals what actions must
                        be taken in urgency to preserve our precious oceans. Roberts is a professor of marine

                        it five years previously. He has a bachelor’s
                        degree in Zoology, a master’s degree in Marine Ecology and Evolution, and a PhD that he received
                        for his pioneering research on pygmy seahorses;
                        it was the first PhD ever awarded for the subject. His book, The World Beneath: The Life and
